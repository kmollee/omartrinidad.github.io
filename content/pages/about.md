title: About me

I am Omar, and I am nerd. I love reading and programming. My favorite
programming language is Python, but I also like Bash.

# About this blog

My old blog is 314159bits, when I knew Pelican and Github pages I thought it
was time to leave my first blog and try something more minimalist.
