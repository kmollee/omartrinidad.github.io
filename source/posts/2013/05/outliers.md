Outliers is the last book I've read. 

# Chapter one

It makes a difference where and when we grew up.

Biologists often talk about the "ecology" of an organism:
the tallest oak in the forest is the tallest not just because
it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because
no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was 
deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a sapling,
and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured. We all know
that successful people come from hardy seeds. But do we know
enough about the sunlight that warmed them, the soil in which
they put down the roots, and the rabbits and lumberjacks 
they were lucky enough to avoid?

# Hockey players in Canada

In Canada the most of the successful hockey players born
in: January, February, and March.

The explanation for this is quite simple. It has nothing to
do with astrology, nor is there anything magical about the 
first three months of the year. It's simply that in Canada
the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1. A
boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing alongside
someone who doesn't turn ten until the end of the year.

# The three lessons of Joe Flom

Those three things -autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and
reward- are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it
is to be satisfying. It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us
happy between nine and five. It's wheter our work fulfills us.
